# Rhombus Oracles

## Lighthouse
Rhombus `lighthouse` contracts are easy destinations for Oracle data. Designed to be updated at maximum gas efficiency, lighthouses are able to be interrogated to reveal the data, when it was updated and a nonce.

The folder contains the interface and implementation of the Lighthouse oracle
service. If you use truffle, you can quickly get started using our Lighthouse
contracts with `truffle install rhombus-box`.

More information at our docmentation: https://docs.rhombus.network

## Demos
TenCentsAMinute uses a Lighthouse oracle to register subscriptions to a video
feed. More documentation inside the folder.
